# Open Foris Collect

Easy and flexible survey design and data management

Open Foris Collect is the main entry point for data collected in field-based inventories. It provides a fast, easy, flexible way to set up a survey with a user-friendly interface.
Collect handles multiple data types and complex validation rules, all in a multi-language environment.

Developed under the [Open Foris Initiative](https://www.openforis.org)

## Key Features

* **User Friendliness**: Nice web interface; Designed based on real users’ needs, No need for technical skills to use it.
* **Rapid Data Entry**: Limited use of mouse needed; Data entry using only keyboard; Auto-complete; Species list search; Immediate feedback on errors/warnings.
* **Highly Configurable**: Design the survey from scratch or starting from a template; Data entry user interface is automatically generated and metadata driven; Validation rules (distance, comparison, pattern...); Multiple layouts (form, table, multiple columns form).
* **Multiple data types**: Basic Types – Text, Number, Boolean, Date, Time. Complex types – Range, Coordinate, File, Taxon. Plus, support for calculated values.
* **Multi-user or standalone**: It can be used in a standalone environment with no need for internet connection; Data can be exported from single/standalone installations and imported into a centralized installation to create a complete data set; In multi-user environment, users can work only on owned records.
* **Controlled QA workflow**: Record goes through different steps: Data entry, Data cleansing, Data analysis. Minimized "data cooking". 
* **Rich metadata**: XML format, Complex nested structure of the survey, Validation rules, Multiple Spatial Reference Systems.
* **Multilingual**: Define the survey in multiple languages - Tab labels, Input field labels, Validation messages, Code item labels, Element info tooltips. The user will see the survey in the language of his/her web browser or in the survey default language.
* **Multiple data export/import formats**: XML, CSV, Relational database. 

## Where to download the installer?

If you are not interested in the code but rather on the Collect features you might want to run it right away!
Go to our [website](https://www.openforis.org/tools/collect.html) and download the installer directly there. There are versions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux 32-bit and 64-bit. 


## Install and run Collect as a Docker container

### Prerequisites

- [download and install Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

- Install a local database (PostgreSQL) as a Docker container. Run this command from command line; it will create also a database named 'arena' and a user 'arena' with password 'arena' and will make the DBMS listen on port 5444 (you can change those parameters as you wish):

```console
$ docker run -d --name collect-db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_DB=collect -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=collect123 -e POSTGRES_USER=collect postgis/postgis:12-3.0
```
You can also use an already existing PostgreSQL database installed in a different way and configure Collect to connect to it.

### Prepare a file with the parameters to pass to Collect

The file (call it **collect.env**) must be a text file with this content:

```properties
COLLECT_DB_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver
COLLECT_DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/collect
COLLECT_DB_USERNAME=collect
COLLECT_DB_PASSWORD=collect123
```

### Install and run Collect
Running the following command from command line will install Collect as a Docker container:

```console
$ docker run -m 4GB -p 8080:8080 --env-file ./collect.env openforis/collect:latest
```
You can run this command in the same folder where you have defined the collect.env file or specify its path in the command, in the '--env-file' parameter.
Collect will start on the port specified in the collect.env file (8080 by default).
You can use the same command to start up Collect again once you stop it.

### Open Collect in the web browser
Once the Collect Docker container is started, you can access Collect user interface through your web browser at the address: <http://localhost:8080/collect>
