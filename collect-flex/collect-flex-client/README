The application uses an additional compiler options file.
The template of this file is located into src/main/resources/flex-config.xml
At compile time the file used will be located into target/classes/flex-config.xml 

In order to compile the application using Flash Builder you have to:

- provide the flex-config.xml to the Additional compiler arguments in the project properties / Flex Compiler section
	(you can use that generated in the project build directory during the compilation)

	for example: -load-config+=/dev/projects/openforis/collect/collect-flex/collect-flex-client/target/classes/flex-config.xml
	
or
	
- define manually the required compiler constants as additional compiler arguments:
	
	for example: -define+=CONFIG::debug,true -define+=CONFIG::version,'0.1-SNAPSHOT'
